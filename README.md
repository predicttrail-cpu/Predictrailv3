    *   Predicted time and pace for each segment of the race.
    *   Estimated calorie expenditure.

## Local Development Setup

To run the PredictTrail application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/votre-utilisateur/PredictTrail.git
    cd PredictTrail
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
    - Create and activate a Python virtual environment. This isolates the project dependencies.
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```
    - Install the required dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - The application requires API keys for Strava. You will need to create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory.
    - Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following content, replacing the placeholders with your actual Strava API credentials:
      ```
      STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_strava_client_id
      STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_strava_client_secret
      ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    - From the root directory of the project, execute the `run.sh` script:
      ```bash
      ./run.sh
      ```
    - The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
